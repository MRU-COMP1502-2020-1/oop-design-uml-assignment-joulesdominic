Q3. 		
		The file called prog2.java is better because firstly, its instance variable is private. It also
	calls the proper method that gets the string, as .name() is not method.

Q4. 
		It is bad because there are methods that are unrelated to function of the class. The way to improve
	the class, is to remove the validateLocation(), checkFTP(), and ping() methods.
